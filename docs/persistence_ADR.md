# Persistence Style Architectural Decision

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context

The retail management system requires a robust data access layer to handle complex business operations including:

- User authentication and profile management
- Product catalog with inventory tracking
- Shopping cart operations with stock validation
- Order processing with atomic transactions
- Payment processing with transaction integrity

The system needs to balance:
- Development speed and maintainability
- Data integrity and consistency
- Business logic encapsulation
- Testing and debugging capabilities
- Team productivity and code reusability

Key requirements include:
- Automatic SQL generation and optimization
- Database migration management
- Relationship handling and foreign key constraints
- Transaction management for financial operations
- Query optimization and caching
- Model validation and business rule enforcement

## Decision

We chose **Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** as the primary persistence pattern for the retail management system.

### Technical Implementation
- Django Models for all data entities
- Django ORM for all database operations
- Django Migrations for schema management
- Django's built-in transaction management
- Model validation and business logic integration

### Example Implementation
```python
# Product model with business logic
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    stock_quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=0)
    
    @property
    def is_in_stock(self):
        return self.stock_quantity > 0

# Order processing with atomic transactions
from django.db import transaction

@transaction.atomic
def process_order(cart_items, user, address):
    sale = Sale.objects.create(user=user, address=address, total=total)
    for item in cart_items:
        SaleItem.objects.create(sale=sale, product=item.product, 
                               quantity=item.quantity, unit_price=item.product.price)
        item.product.stock_quantity -= item.quantity
        item.product.save()
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Rapid Development**: Automatic SQL generation reduces boilerplate code
- **Type Safety**: Python model definitions provide compile-time checking
- **Migration Management**: Automatic schema evolution with rollback capabilities
- **Relationship Handling**: Automatic foreign key management and cascading operations
- **Transaction Support**: Built-in atomic transaction management
- **Query Optimization**: Automatic query optimization and lazy loading
- **Admin Interface**: Automatic admin interface generation
- **Testing Support**: Easy model testing and fixtures
- **Business Logic Integration**: Model methods and properties for business rules
- **Security**: Built-in SQL injection protection

### Negative Consequences
- **Performance Overhead**: ORM abstraction may impact performance for complex queries
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Django ORM patterns
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tight coupling to Django framework
- **Limited SQL Control**: Less control over raw SQL generation
- **Memory Usage**: Object instantiation overhead for large datasets
- **Debugging Complexity**: ORM-generated SQL can be harder to debug

### Trade-offs
- **Productivity vs. Performance**: Chose development speed over micro-optimization
- **Abstraction vs. Control**: Prioritized high-level abstraction over low-level control
- **Framework Dependency vs. Flexibility**: Accepted Django coupling for rapid development

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern
- **Pros**: Full control over SQL, performance optimization, framework independence
- **Cons**: Significant development overhead, manual SQL writing, complex relationship handling
- **Decision**: Rejected due to development time constraints and complexity

### Raw SQL with Database Cursor
- **Pros**: Maximum performance, complete SQL control, minimal overhead
- **Cons**: SQL injection risks, manual relationship handling, no migration support
- **Decision**: Rejected due to security concerns and maintenance overhead

### Repository Pattern with Custom ORM
- **Pros**: Clean separation of concerns, testable interfaces, framework independence
- **Cons**: Significant implementation effort, duplicate ORM functionality
- **Decision**: Rejected due to development time and complexity

### Hybrid Approach (ORM + Raw SQL)
- **Pros**: Best of both worlds, performance where needed, ORM convenience elsewhere
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, inconsistent patterns, harder maintenance
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity and team size constraints

## Implementation Examples

### Business Logic Integration
```python
# Cart model with business rules
class Cart:
    def add(self, product, quantity=1):
        if not product.is_active:
            raise ValueError(f"Product {product.name} is not available")
        if quantity > product.stock_quantity:
            raise ValueError(f"Insufficient stock")
        # ORM operations with business validation
```

### Atomic Transactions
```python
# Order processing with transaction integrity
@transaction.atomic
def checkout_cart(cart, user, address):
    sale = Sale.objects.create(user=user, address=address, total=cart.get_total_price())
    for item in cart:
        SaleItem.objects.create(sale=sale, product=item['product'], 
                               quantity=item['quantity'], unit_price=item['price'])
        item['product'].stock_quantity -= item['quantity']
        item['product'].save()
```

### Model Relationships
```python
# Complex relationships handled automatically
class Sale(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    items = models.ManyToManyField(Product, through='SaleItem')

class SaleItem(models.Model):
    sale = models.ForeignKey(Sale, related_name="items", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
```
