# Database Architectural Decision

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context

The retail management system requires a database to store user accounts, product catalogs, shopping cart data, order history, and payment records. The system needs to support:

- User authentication and profile management
- Product catalog with categories, pricing, and inventory tracking
- Shopping cart functionality for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Order processing with atomic transactions
- Payment processing and transaction history
- Admin functionality for product management

Key requirements include:
- ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Relational data integrity
- Support for complex queries and relationships
- Development simplicity and rapid prototyping
- Low operational overhead for a small team

## Decision

We chose **SQLite** as the primary database technology for the retail management system.

### Technical Implementation
- Database engine: `django.db.backends.sqlite3`
- Database file: `src/db.sqlite3`
- Django ORM for all database operations
- Atomic transactions using Django's transaction management

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Zero Configuration**: No separate database server setup required
- **Development Speed**: Immediate database creation and migration support
- **ACID Compliance**: Full transaction support for financial operations
- **Portability**: Single file database that can be easily backed up and moved
- **Cost Effective**: No licensing fees or server infrastructure costs
- **Django Integration**: Excellent ORM support with migrations and admin interface
- **Reliability**: Proven technology with extensive testing and production use

### Negative Consequences
- **Concurrency Limitations**: SQLite supports limited concurrent writes (one writer at a time)
- **Scalability Constraints**: Not suitable for high-traffic applications with multiple concurrent users
- **No Network Access**: Database file must be accessible locally
- **Limited Advanced Features**: No built-in replication, clustering, or advanced indexing
- **Performance**: May not perform as well as dedicated database servers for complex queries

### Trade-offs
- **Simplicity vs. Scalability**: Chose development simplicity over enterprise scalability
- **Cost vs. Performance**: Prioritized zero-cost solution over high-performance database
- **Team Size**: Appropriate for small team without dedicated database administrator

## Alternatives Considered

### PostgreSQL
- **Pros**: Advanced features, excellent performance, strong ACID compliance, JSON support
- **Cons**: Requires separate server setup, more complex configuration, higher operational overhead
- **Decision**: Rejected due to increased complexity for a small team project

### MySQL
- **Pros**: Popular, good performance, wide hosting support
- **Cons**: Requires separate server setup, configuration complexity, licensing considerations
- **Decision**: Rejected due to operational overhead and setup complexity

### NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, CouchDB)
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling, document-based storage
- **Cons**: No ACID compliance, complex relationships, limited Django support
- **Decision**: Rejected due to lack of ACID compliance required for financial transactions

### Cloud Databases (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- **Pros**: Managed service, automatic backups, scaling capabilities
- **Cons**: Cost, vendor lock-in, internet dependency, complexity
- **Decision**: Rejected due to cost and complexity for a small project

## Implementation Notes

The decision is implemented through Django's settings configuration:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

This choice supports the project's goals of rapid development, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness while providing sufficient functionality for the retail management system's requirements.
